- 👋 Hi, I’m @faviangit
- 👀 I read that you can build anything with code, I think thats fascinating.
- 🌱 I’m a CS student taking my first programming class C++.
- 💞️ I'd like to do some real work before I finish school. No task too small or tedious.
- I'll do anything. Aside from homework, I'm writing baby programs at the moment and whatever ideas pop into my head.
- Classes I've taken: intro C++, Linux, Assembly Language & Computer Architecture (Fall '25), OOP (Spring '26).
- My goal is to become an Embedded SWD
- I'd also like to talk to experienced devs and learn the ropes.
