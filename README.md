- 👋 Hi, I’m @faviangit
- 👀 I read that you can do anything with code. I think thats very interesting. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and I'm enjoying programming whatever pops into my head.
- 💞️ I'm taking a Python for Everybody course. I know it's not much but is there any way I can help? I'm looking for some real experience and I'll do anything to get some real work done. No job too small or tedious.
